## Process

Day 1: Planning(Trello), wireframes, decide on mvp

Planning for this project was very intensive. We used Trello to collect all of our plans and ideas into one space where we could check with the group and decide who would be doing what. For the first part of this project we decided on splitting into two teams, one working on the frontend and one on the backend. I was one of the backend people. We decided that for our MVP we would need users that can login, build and search for quests, and view the quests on a map. Wireframing out what each page would look like and what our user stories were going to be was really helpful for planning what features we needed and which would be nice to have.

Day 2: Deciding on backend models, building authentification but not activating it, deciding on user stories.

Building the schema models and deciding which would fit in as model objects was achieved mostly through pair coding. We built the controllers next, starting with the quest controllers needed by the frontend team. Turning our focus to the users, we build the controllers and then started implimenting authentification

Day 3: Adding error handling, solidified relationships.

Day 4: Front end support, building seed data.

Day 5: More seed data, profile pages, filtering.

Day 6: Stress testing, populating comments section.

## Challenges and Extra Features

Sorting lists and styling after other people.

## Wins and Key Learnings

Backend framework and building out the profile stuff.
